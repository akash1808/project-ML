Controversial new UK casinos will be banned from using American tricks of the trade to ensure they are "socially responsible", it has been suggested.

Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said proposed super-casinos will be different from their US counterparts. In America, pheromones have reportedly been released from machines to encourage aggressive gambling and clocks are often removed from walls.

She told The Times: "British casinos will be quite different to those overseas.

"They will have to act in a socially responsible way and will be tightly regulated. "They will be run according to British rules and we'll simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling."

Casinos also frequently offer free food, drink and hotel accommodation to keep punters betting.
