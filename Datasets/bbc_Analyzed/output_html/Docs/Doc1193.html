"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell."

Tory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. "After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world," he added.
