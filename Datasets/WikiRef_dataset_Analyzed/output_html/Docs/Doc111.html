Connect smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance and image quality.

The S5 is the latest model in Samsung's line of Galaxy S flagship smartphones and replaces last year's Galaxy S4. The new model's camera comes with a slightly larger 1/2.6-inch CMOS BSI sensor and an increased pixel-count of 16MP (up from the S4's 13MP) but the maximum aperture remains unchanged at F2.2. Like its phablet sibling the Galaxy Note III, the S5 offers 4K video capture but has to make do without an optical image stabilization system.

Samsung also claims to have improved AF speeds by implementing a phase-detection system, similar to what's being used in digital SLRs. Other new imaging features include real-time HDR processing , a new camera user interface and the Selective Focus feature that allows you to blur the background by taking two pictures at different focus settings and merging them, similar to Background Defocus on the Sony Xperia Z2 or Nokia's Refocus app.

In terms of design, with its rounded corners, metal band around the edges and the faux-leather back, the S5 looks like a cross between Galaxy S4 and Note III. However, the new model is also dust and water resistant with an IP67 rating, which means you can keep snapping in adverse weather conditions. As you would expect from a Galaxy S device the non-camera components are top-notch, too. Android 4.4.2 is powered by a Qualcomm quad-core 2.5 GHz Snapdragon S801 processor and 2GB of RAM.
