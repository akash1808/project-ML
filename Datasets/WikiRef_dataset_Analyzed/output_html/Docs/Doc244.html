Officials had urged Parisians to stay home and out of the streets. Museums were closed, and so was the Eiffel Tower. Despite that, defiant crowds still gathered on Saturday evening in Place de la R�publique, just as they had after this city was last attacked.

�I came here with my children to let them see that we should not be afraid,� said Raphaella Giraudi, who had tears in her eyes as she held the hands of her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son.

Throughout the evening, scores of people passed through the square, huddling around the monument at its center, with its looming statue of Marianne, the symbol of the French republic.

They lit candles and left messages with condolences, quotes and poems. Children left behind drawings. At one point, someone brought a speaker and played John Lennon�s �Imagine.�

�There is a lot of dignity in this gathering,� said Yannick Mercier, a 49-year-old plumber. �This statue has become a symbol.�

In January, after gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, Parisians came to the square to publicly mourn. There was a silent march through the square and a yellow pencil emblazoned with the words �Je Suis Charlie� was placed in the hand of a figurine at the base of the monument.

There was a pervasive sense of defiance among those at the square on Saturday. They believed that the attacks were intended to curtail their way of life.

�The terrorists have lost,� said Maxime Lauret, 19, who came with two friends on Saturday, �because, as you see today, many people having a drink outside, in cafes.�

For Mr. Mercier, it was a satisfying sight. �I am happy to see that people are not afraid,� he said.
