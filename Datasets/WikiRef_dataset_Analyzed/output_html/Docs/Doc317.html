I brought Samsung�s new Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy S5 Active smartphones home and put them out on a table to show my daughter.

She picked up Samsung Alpha, barely glancing at the S5 Active, the ruggedized version of the S5.

Flipping it around in her hand, she had hardly turned it on when she announced: �This is the one I�d want.�

And that was probably Samsung�s intent in delivering its most elegant phone yet, a metal-framed device that, at 4.7-inches has the same screen size as Apple�s new iPhone 6 and is considerably smaller than the Galaxy S5, which has a  5.1-inch display. With its best design to date, Samsung is no doubt hoping  to appeal to users who are drawn to form before function.

There�s a market for a range of phones and in this case, the Galaxy Alpha appeared to be the one that would convince my daughter, a university undergrad, to make the shift from Apple to Alpha. And that after she has used an iPhone since the first one was released in Canada.

In an interview, Samsung�s Ken Price said that�s what it�s all about � delivering choice for the consumer.

�Samsung is all about choice and variety for our users and so we have a couple of choices for people to makes as they go into the holiday season,� he said.

Interestingly his teen daughter also prefers the Alpha. Parents of course � if they�re still paying for their kids� phones � would probably rather they carry the rugged phone.

I�m trying out both the Alpha and the Active and for my active west coast lifestyle, the S5 Active is the answer � delivering all the features of the S5 but in a ruggedized form that will take more of the mishaps of daily life without having to be safeguarded inside an expensive case. I like the feel of the Alpha, both in my hand and in my pocket, but I�d choose the Active because the Alpha is missing some features that I particularly like in the larger phone.
