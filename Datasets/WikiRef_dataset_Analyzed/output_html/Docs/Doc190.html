Michelle Obama is the first to admit she is a bargain hunter when it comes to fashion and it�s paid off as her effortless style has made People magazine�s Best Dressed list for 2008.

When she was a guest on �The View,� one mention from Michelle noting that she bought her sundress off-the-rack at a chain store started a fashion frenzy for the item.

Joining Michelle on the list, which didn�t rank the stars in any particular order, was Sarah Jessica Parker. Not only is her style sophisticated, but it takes a special kind of dresser to make a flowerpot hat look chic, which Sarah Jessica did at the �Sex and The City� movie premiere in London.

In naming her to their list, People wrote Sarah Jessica �effortlessly mixes high-end and affordable prices,� no doubt referring to her Bitten line, which sells in the economical fashion chain store, Steve & Barry.

Gwyneth Paltrow and her short dresses got her on to People�s list because �she plays up her legs,� according to the mag.

As for Rihanna, it was her stylish hair that helped secure the singer�s spot on the list. She was also praised because she �straddles the line between sweet and street.�

Also named to the best dressed list were supermodel and TV host Heidi Klum, singer Fergie, actress Charlize Theron and actresses Kate Hudson, Eva Mendes and Anne Hathaway.

While People stopped short of naming a Worst Dressed list, they did call out several stars including �American Idol� judge Paula Abdul, actresses Lucy Liu, Sienna Miller and Tilda Swinton, and singers Solange Knowles and Tori Amos for wearing the �Worst Dresses.�
