In the past two decades, the composition of England's top-flight teams has changed dramatically.

At the start of the 1989-90 season, leading clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United boasted just one or two regular first-team players who were born outside the United Kingdom.

Now, Premier League teams have, on average, 13 foreign-born stars within their ranks. 

Use the interactive world map above to explore the birthplaces of players in all the current Premier League squads, and compare them with the same teams' players from the start of the 1989-90 season - then find out more about each team below.

Twenty years ago, defending champions Arsenal had just two players born outside the UK on their books: Icelandic midfielder Sigurdur Jonsson and Irish forward Niall Quinn.

Jonsson made barely a handful of appearances before leaving Highbury in 1992, while Quinn was soon to sign for Manchester City.

Liverpool, eventual title-winners that season, had an unusually large number of foreign-born players in their 1989-90 squad.

Kenny Dalglish's side featured five players born outside the UK: John Barnes (Jamaica), Bruce Grobbelaar (South Africa), Glenn Hysen (Sweden), Jan Molby (Denmark) and Steve Staunton (Republic of Ireland).

But they were the exception. Teams were far more likely to boast just one or two players born outside the UK and, in many cases (such as Manchester City's David Oldfield and Chelsea's Tony Dorigo), those players were British nationals who happened to have been born abroad.

Two decades ago, the teams making up this year's Premier League could only boast 12 players born outside the Commonwealth between them.

Twenty years later, more than half of the Premier League's clubs could field an entire starting line-up of foreign-born players.

Liverpool now have just three UK-born first-team stars in Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson, with other British talents like Jay Spearing making only occasional European appearances to date.

Anfield is home to 20 foreign-born players with a strong first-team claim, while Arsenal can boast 23, as opposed to four Brits, all aged under 21.

Teams recently promoted to the top flight have the fewest foreign-born players in their first-team squads - Burnley have seven, Wolves have eight, as do Stoke, who gained promotion a year earlier, while Birmingham have nine.

West Ham are also at the lower end of the spectrum, with nine foreign-born players, but at the time of writing this still comprised almost half of the 21 first-team players at Gianfranco Zola's disposal.

Jonsson and Quinn, mentioned above, were as exotic as it got for the Gunners 20 years ago.

Arsenal could almost have put out a starting line-up featuring only players born in the London area.

By contrast, in February 2005, manager Arsene Wenger became the first in English football to field a matchday squad lacking any English players.

The current squad's UK-born talents - Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere - are all under 21 years old.

Points on the map

2009-10: Carlos Vela, who waited more than three years for his first Arsenal goal (and two of those waiting for a work permit), is Mexican. Brazilians Denilson and Eduardo hail from Sao Paulo and Rio respectively.

There are three imports from West Africa - Emmanuel Eboue, Johan Djourou and Alex Song, while Andrey Arshavin was born in St Petersburg, Russia.
