In the News: First lady Michelle Obama revealed on Wednesday (February 25, 2009) that the family plans to get a dog after their spring break trip this April. Barack and Michelle Obama promised their daughters a dog after the election.

Obama says her daughters have already been going back and forth on possible names. "Oh, the names are really bad," she said. "I don't even want to mention it...Frank was one of them. Frank! Moose was another one of them. Moose. I'm like, no, come on, let's work with the names a little bit."
