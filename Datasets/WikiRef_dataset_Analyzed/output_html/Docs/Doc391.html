One week after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday that the search has �entered a new phase� amid proof the plane had been deliberately turned away from its original flight path.

Indian authorities said the country is still searching the areas Malaysia had instructed it to scan for the missing Boeing BA +2.05% 777.  Indian ships, planes and helicopters continued to look for signs of the jet on land and in the waters around the remote islands of Andaman and Nicobar.

No clues of what had happen to the flight had been found and India had been given no new instructions on where to search by Saturday morning,  Port Blair based joint forces Commander in Chief P.K Roy told The Wall Street Journal

Based on information from satellites and radar after the plane�s transponder was switched off, Malaysian Prime Minister Razak said, investigators are looking at two possible corridors through which the jet could have flown: a northern corridor from the border of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to Thailand and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

�We are ending our operations in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets, we are working with all relevant data including radar,� Mr. Razak said. Because the search area now involved many countries, the relevant nations had been asked to attend a meeting at the Malaysian Foreign Ministry, he added.

India joined the search for the missing jet this week after a request from the Malaysian authorities. Its investigation so far has concentrated on the waters of the Andaman Sea and the hundreds of uninhabited islands that make up Andaman and Nicobar.

The Boeing 777�s movements as it turned back on itself over Malaysia and then flew further north west  last Saturday were �consistent with deliberate action from someone on the plane�, Mr. Razak said.

The Malaysian authorities and teams from 14 countries, including India and more than 50 ships and 40 aircraft, are now involved in the search for the plane which blinked off radar screens in the early hours of Saturday, the 8th of March.
