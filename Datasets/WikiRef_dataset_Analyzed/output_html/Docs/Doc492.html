Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Barclays Premier League, knows he is in a privileged position. When it comes to selling a British company abroad, he has a head-start on most other businesses. After all, he has no need to explain what he is selling.

�I go in and talk about something people recognise,� he says. �I don�t have to tell people who I am or where I am from. It�s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.�

Not many institutions can boast such instant recognition, but the Premier League has that advantage and more. The rights have been sold in 212 territories and there are none left to conquer.

�I�ve never had a problem doing business,� Scudamore says. �We can go anywhere, because of who we are.�

The Premier League has become a worldwide business, and Scudamore says that it is partly due to a commercial decision, made at the turn of the century, that changed the way broadcasting rights were sold. He was unhappy that they were being sold to just one agency, with the agency taking its cut. Now Scudamore deals with the rights on an individual basis, having what he says is a �direct relationship� with the broadcasters. His three-strong team deals with 80 different broadcasters.

Another big change is the influx of foreign players. Back in 1992 there were only 11 non-British or Irish footballers in the Premier League. That has changed significantly.

�We had 71 different nationalities playing last season,� says Scudamore, who has been chief executive for nearly 15 years. �That means 71 avid international markets.�

The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world (its TV audience is 4.7 billion) and the latest deals made (each is on a three-year cycle; the next starts from the 2013-14 season) will bring in �3 billion in the UK, and up to �2.5 billion internationally.

Although football is now a global sport, the Premier League sells itself very much along British lines. �Being British is the essence of what we are,� Scudamore says. �Why would we play that down?

�We�ve got two fantastic things in our advantage,� he says. �One is our heritage, culture, history and the authenticity of it all. People crave that authenticity, whether it is a British landmark or a crest on a football shirt that goes back to the 19th century.�

However, another British benefit is geographic, rather than historic. �Greenwich Mean Time is very much in our favour,� Scudamore says. �People underestimate the importance of GMT, but when you�re operating a business, it means you sit right in the middle. You can deal with the Far East and California in the same day.�

Scudamore accepts that his business is unusual. Not only does it have that instant recognition, but it is also unconnected to product development.

�We don�t have to create a new product every time we want to sign a contract,� he says. �Clubs renew players and managers and it feels brand new. What we do is more about product protection � we can concentrate and focus on promotion, selling and marketing.�

He and his small team work hard, travelling around the world, but he is convinced that having such a small team is a huge benefit, because �it means people know who to speak to, that we are responsive and consistent in what we do�.

When Scudamore talks, it becomes clear that he alsobelieves he uses what some would describe as British values. He emphasises more than once that �courtesy� is vital. �You need to be very clear about what you are selling,� he says, �and that takes time. We sometimes do business with people on our sixth or seventh attempt. We also try to keep relationships going with old licensees.
