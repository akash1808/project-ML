The French and Belgian authorities have established a growing list of individuals suspected of participating in the Islamic State�s terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13. Of the 10 assailants directly involved in the attacks, one remains at large. 

Connections to the Organizer of the Attacks

Abdelhamid Abaaoud is suspected of being a leader of a branch of the Islamic State in Syria called Katibat al-Battar al Libi, which has its origins in Libya. Bilal Hadfi was in contact through Facebook with members of the branch and is thought to have linked arms with Mr. Abaaoud in Syria.

Ibrahim and Salah Abdeslam, who are brothers, lived near Mr. Abaaoud in Molenbeek, a district in Brussels known as a haven for extremists.

Isma�l Omar Mostefa� had been in contact with Mr. Abaaoud, according to a French official.

Hasna Aitboulahcen, Mr. Abaaoud�s cousin, and Jawad Bendaoud are suspected of helping Mr. Abaaoud find housing in a Paris suburb after the attacks.


The Molenbeek Connection

Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Ibrahim Abdeslam spent time in the same Brussels prison and were friends.

Mr. Abaaoud, the Abdeslam brothers, Hamza Attou and Mohamed Amri spent time together at a neighborhood bar. After the attacks, Salah Abdeslam asked Mr. Attou and Mr. Amri to drive him back to Brussels. Ali O. and Abraimi Lazez, who are also suspected of helping Salah Abdeslam flee after the attacks, also lived in Molenbeek.

Ayoub el Khazzani, a Moroccan who tried to attack passengers on a high-speed train between Brussels and Paris in August, is thought to have lived there.




French police raided an apartment early on Nov. 18 in the northern Paris suburb of St.-Denis, a few miles from where the suicide bomb attacks at the Stade de France took place. Three people died, including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian man who is suspected of planning the Paris attacks, and his 26-year-old cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen.
