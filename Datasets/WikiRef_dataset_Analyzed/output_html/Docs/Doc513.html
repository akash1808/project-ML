 Of the seemingly hundreds of phone models produced by Samsung each year, none are more important to the Korean phone maker than the Galaxy S series. Samsung�s flagship series crams all the latest hardware and software into a phone that has a halo effect for all mobile things carrying the Samsung label.

The Galaxy SIII and S4 have been blockbuster sales hits, and we expect no less from the Galaxy S5. And now, after months of rumors and leaked specs, the GS5 is official. Samsung�s new flagship phone is coming on April 11. What does it have in store for us?
The specs

Let�s cut to the chase. What did Samsung pack inside their its flagship phone?

    Size: 5.6 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches
    Weight: 5.1 ounces
    Processor: 2.5 GHz quad-core processor
    Display: 5.1-inch Super AMOLED, 1920 x 1080 (~430 ppi)
    OS: Android 4.4.2 KitKat (with Samsung�s latest TouchWiz on top)
    RAM: 2GB
    Storage: 16/32GB, with MicroSD slot up to 128GB
    Cameras: 2.1 megapixels up front, 16 megapixels on the rear camera
    Video: Ultra HD @ 30fps, HDR, and video stabilization
    Wireless: LTE Cat.4, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, NFC, IR
    Battery: 2800 mAh

Small improvements in core hardware

This is a cutting-edge phone, as expected. It�s a little larger and a little heavier than the Galaxy S4, but not much. It doesn�t look dramatically different from the GS4, with one major exception�the back features a perforated texture that should give it a much nicer feel than the basic, slick plastic on last year�s model. 

 One place the rumor mill got the story very wrong is in predicting a quad-HD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. Instead, the Galaxy S5 will sport a more pedestrian 1920 x 1080 full-HD screen. At 5.1 inches, just a hair bigger than the GS4, that gives you a similar pixel density of 430ppi. 

Samsung promises improvements, including local contrast enhancement, which measuring the ambient light and adjusts the display accordingly, to maintain visibility even in bright outdoor light.

The processor powering the phone wasn�t mentioned by name, only that it is a �2.5 GHz quad-core� processor. Our guess is that this is probably a Snapdragon 801 or 805. That�s a decent step up from the Snapdragon 600 in the Galaxy S4, but it�s not a big leap over other top-end Android phones. The 2GB of RAM it�s rockin� is also de rigeur in a premium Android phone.

The battery has been boosted from 2600mAh to 2800mAh, still not very impressive compared to the biggest-battery phones on the market. Samsung promises 10 hours of web browsing and 12 hours of video playback, but it�s best to take specs like that with a grain of salt. Frankly, we were hoping for a 3000mAh battery or better.

A feature called Ultra Power Saving Mode sounds like a nice software innovation similar to what we�ve seen on Lumia devices. It turns the screen black and white, and kills all tasks except the essentials like texts and phone calls. Even with just a little battery life left, Samsung promises huge standby time in this mode. Call it peace of mind when you�re not near a charger and still want to get that emergency call.
Focus on the camera

The 16-megapixel rear camera is a point of pride for Samsung�s new flagship phone. A new fast autofocus mode combines traditional autofocus and phase detection autofocus. It can lock in a shot in 0.3 seconds, Samsung claims. This is a big deal�the camera on the GS4 is high-res, but quite slow, and suffers from annoying focus problems. A new HDR mode allows for much faster HDR shots, and can even take HDR video. Speaking of video, there�s support for shooting u...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic26.html>galaxy samsung phone camera screen sensor</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic21.html>samsung gs phone scanner back galaxy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic37.html>image galaxy camera noise images detail</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic28.html>samsung camera focus good light make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>battery power life mode gs display</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
