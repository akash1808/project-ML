First, she had to unclench her fist. 

Michelle Obama�s opening move as a guest co-host of �The View� on Wednesday was to joke about the famous bump that she had given her husband the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, and that was described by the Fox News anchor E.D. Hill as a �terrorist fist jab.� Mrs. Obama said she was not really �that hip� and credited her husband�s campaign workers for the gesture. �I got that from the young staff,� she said. �It�s the new high five.�

And in that way, and perhaps only that way, Mrs. Obama looked a little like the wife of her husband�s Republican opponent, Cindy McCain, who also used a co-hosting appearance on �The View� last April to smooth over her campaign kerfuffle.

Recipes posted on the McCain campaign Web site as Mrs. McCain�s family�s favorites turned out to be copied word-for-word from ones by Rachael Ray and others. Mrs. McCain told the show�s hosts that an intern had posted the recipes without permission and been duly punished. �That intern is now, I�m happy to say, at the Betty Crocker boot camp,� she joked.

The amount of scrutiny the two spouses face is not commensurate � Mrs. Obama has endured far more virulent attacks by her critics � but it is somehow symmetrical. Mrs. Obama went on a popular television talk show to combat the notion that she is a little too authentic to be a first lady, while Mrs. McCain did it to undercut the image that she is too fake.

It is a familiar pattern. Democratic candidates� wives � from Rosalynn Carter and Kitty Dukakis to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Teresa Heinz Kerry � are almost invariably characterized by opponents as too feisty and too outspoken, a little too radical for mainstream America. Betty Ford was an early exception to the Republican rule of bland, self-effacing homemakers; as the Equal Rights Amendment faded as a cause and conservatism made a comeback, Republican spouses became ever more care...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(92%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic30.html>obama michelle mrs husband campaign mr</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
