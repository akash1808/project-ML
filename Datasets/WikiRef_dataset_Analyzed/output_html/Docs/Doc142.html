KOREAN ELECTRONICS CONGLOMERATE Samsung has managed to shift one million of its Wave smartphones.

The Wave managed to reach the sales milestone in just four weeks, a feat that is made more important by the fact that the device is the first to run Samsung's Bada operating system. Putting Samsung's sales figures into perspective, Apple's first Iphone took over 80 days to reach the million mark.

Bada is Samsung's attempt to move its devices away from proprietary operating systems that offer little in terms of expandability. Depending on the device's specifications, Bada could be deployed with either a Linux or some other real-time operating system.

The firm is hoping that Bada becomes a credible alternative to other smartphone operating systems, and to that end Bada has an application store. The firm is currently running a competition to boost application development, though it expects to have 7,000 applications by the end of the year. In contrast, Apple's App Store already has over 200,000 applications and the Android Market is nearing 100,000.

While Samsung might be pushing Bada, it has hedged its bets by producing a number of devices that run Google's Android operating system, and again, sales figures show that was a pretty good idea.

The company has managed to flog the much vaunted Galaxy S to 300,000 punters in just 19 days. Those figures are all the more impressive when you realise that represents just South Korean sales and that the Galaxy S is targeted at the high-end market. Although overall figures are not quite up there with Motorola's Milestone, the rate is impressive and bodes well for both Samsung and Android developers.

Such healthy sales figures should result in Samsung continuing its two-pronged approach to pursuing greater market share in smartphones.
