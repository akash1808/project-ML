This year�s flagship doesn�t mess with a winning formula

What do you do when you�re one of the world�s largest smartphone makers and it�s time to update your flagship device? If you�re Samsung, you trot out the new Galaxy S5, a refined and updated take on last year�s wildly successful Galaxy S4. Like the new Gear wearables, the Galaxy S5 looks and feels familiar, but offers a number of improvements over last year�s edition.

The Galaxy S5�s design is a minor evolution of the Galaxy S4 � in fact, the two are almost indistinguishable from the front. The S5�s display is ever so slightly larger at 5.1 inches, but it�s still a 1080p, Super AMOLED panel that doesn�t look very different from the S4�s screen. Below the display is a new home key with integrated fingerprint scanner and capacitive keys for multitasking and Android�s back button.

Samsung has retained the familiar metal-looking plastic surround on the S5, though the charging port (now USB 3.0) comes with an integrated port cover for waterproofing. The S5 is IP67-rated for water and dust resistance, meaning it can be submerged in 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes at a time.

Though the S5 is extremely familiar-looking from the front, things take a turn around back, where Samsung has replaced the S4�s slimy, glossy plastic battery cover with a dimpled soft-touch finish. The company is calling this a "modern glam" look, though if you�re familiar with the original Nexus 7 released in 2012, it�s very similar to that.
