When the Beatles sought guidance from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1968, they traveled to India. Now that the �giggling guru,� as he has been called, is seeking investors, a branch of his organization has come to the New York financial district.

In March, Maharishi�s Global Financial Capital of New York quietly opened a headquarters at 70 Broad Street, close to the New York Stock Exchange. The organization had purchased the five-story, 20,000-square-foot building in May 2004 from Goldman Properties for $5.5 million.

The group was drawn to the building, the former home of the American Bank Note Company and its first Manhattan property, for reasons both spiritual and practical.

�It�s one of the very few buildings in all of New York City that�s oriented due east,� said Paul Potter, the director of Global Financial Capital, referring to the Maharishi�s principles of �Vedic architecture� that hold that east-facing buildings are spiritually healthy.

But, Mr. Potter added, the other incentive was the financial district location and access to the world�s moneymakers.

�We�ve been offering our programs for 50 years,� he said, �and now is the time that we want to create financial support for these programs. We want to offer a chance for the investment bankers to steer the finances of the world in this positive direction.�

The building required extensive renovations, which continue, and will cost about $4.9 million, according to the organization, which took out a mortgage in 2005 to cover them. In addition to donations and income from real estate assets, the Maharishi�s worldwide network is financed primarily by classes in transcendental meditation, which cost $2,500 for a one-time, five-day session.

The new building�s first floor is open for business, with meeting rooms to welcome the investment bankers and hold videoconferences. The Maharishi, who is at least 90, conducts many of these Webcasts from a Dutch village, Vlodrop, where he has established his Global Country of World Peace.

The building purchase was a canny one considering the financial district�s resurgence, the broker, David N. Lebenstein, director of the nonprofit division at Colliers ABR, said. �Building prices are at least 30 to 50 percent more than in 2004 and in some cases 100 percent more,� he said, adding that the Maharishi�s choice to buy an entire building is unusual for nonprofits downtown. Most prefer to avoid overhead costs by purchasing commercial condos or leasing long-term office ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(95%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic25.html>world time people business group british</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
