Controversial new UK casinos will be banned from using American tricks of the trade to ensure they are "socially responsible", it has been suggested.

"They will have to act in a socially responsible way and will be tightly regulated. "They will be run according to British rules and we'll simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling."
